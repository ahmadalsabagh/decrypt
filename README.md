# decrypt
For this assignment you need to write an application that takes 3 command-line arguments and decrypts a file into another file: 
 
java Decrypt key input output 
 
key – string key provided                                      
input – input file that contains the text to decrypt in text file format                                       
output – output file generated by Decrypt 
 
 
An example input and the output it produces: 
 
Original (from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher	): 
In cryptography, a substitution cipher is a method of encoding by which units of plaintext are replaced with ciphertext, according to a fixed system; the "units" may be single letters (the most common), pairs of letters, triplets of letters, mixtures of the above, and so forth. The receiver deciphers the text by performing the inverse substitution.

As you can see, any symbols other than 26 English letters and space are replaced with spaces, and all text is converted to uppercase, for simplicity
